The Trade Me sandbox environment is a completely independent copy of the Trade Me website, API and database. It is designed to allow you to test potentially destructive API operations in a safe environment.  Why I choose the Trademe? When I want to choose a product to practice and display my automation demo, I will take some factors into my consideration:\n Does this product is popular and widely used by the public? Is the business complexity of this product enough for me to cover different types of testing practices? Is there a clear enough specification for this product to allow me to develop my demo? Can practicers who see my demo reproduce it in the same product environment?  Trademe exactly fulfills all these above considerations for me.\nTrademe sandbox official materials   Trademe sandbox website\r.\n  Trademe development documents entry\r.\n   Trademe getting started\r.

During UAT, actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications. UAT is one of the final and critical software project procedures that must occur before newly developed software is rolled out to the market.\nUsability Testing Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and takes notes. The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant\u0026rsquo;s satisfaction with the product.\nThe detailed comparison between Alpha testing and Beta testing is as below:\nTypical Usability Test Scenario  The facilitator will welcome the participant and explain the test session, ask the participant to sign the release form, and ask any pre-test or demographic questions. The facilitator explains thinking aloud and asks if the participant has any additional questions. The facilitator explains where to start. The participant reads the task scenario aloud and begins working on the scenario while they think aloud. The note-takers take notes of the participant’s behaviours, comments, errors and completion (success or failure) on each task. The session continues until all task scenarios are completed or time allotted has elapsed. The facilitator either asks the end-of session subjective questions or sends them to an online survey, thanks the participant, gives the participant the agreed-on incentive, and escorts them from the testing environment.

It also has unique project roles, including scrum master, product owner, and development team. It is similar to Kanban in many ways.\nA typical Scrum framework is as below:\nExtreme Programming XP planning addresses two key questions: predicting what will be accomplished by the due date, and determining what to do next.\nThere are two key planning steps in XP: release planning, and iteration planning.\nXP 12 core practices are as below:\nKan ban Kanban uses incremental improvements to continuously add parts or features until such time that the product is fit to be delivered. It allows the development team to visualize their entire workflow. The development process is generally broken down into multiple problems and is managed using a task board.\nThe Kanan 6 core practies are as below:\nLean Lean is a way of working which focuses on the removal of waste from a process.\nThe Lean 7 core principles are as below:\nFeature-Driven Development Feature-Driven Development (FDD) involved creating software models every two weeks and requires a development and design plan for every software model feature.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s main purpose is to deliver tangible, working software repeatedly in a timely manner. The advantage of using FDD is that it is scalable even to large teams due to the concept of ‘just enough design initially’ (JEDI).\nThe FDD 5 basic activies are as below:\nDynamic System Development DSDM is an Agile method that focuses on the full project lifecycle. It is an iterative approach to software development. The framework is built on four principles: feasibility and business study, functional model and prototype iteration, design and build iteration, and implementation.\nThe DSDM 9 principles are as below:\nCrystal Crystal methodology is one of the most lightweight and flexible approaches to develop software.
